# reviewdown

`reviewdown` builds up from the ideas provided by `rmdrive` r-package
<https://github.com/ekothe/rmdrive>, which offers convenience functions
to copy `.Rmd` files to Google Drive for synchronous collaborative
editing, then return them back to a local `.Rmd` file for rendering.

# In Development
